##  Design Prompt Used
The following prompt was used to generate this specific high-fidelity layout in Figma Make:

"Design a dark-themed Gaming Dashboard UI for a web application built with Angular. 

**Layout Structure:**
- **Top Navigation Bar:** Dark navy background. Left-aligned logo 'PIXEL RANK' with a white pixel-art icon. Center-aligned navigation links: 'GAME', 'LEADERBOARD', and 'PROFILE'. Right-aligned 'Logout' button and a user profile dropdown.
- **Main Grid:** A balanced 3-column layout.
- **Column 1 (Game Area):** A card titled 'PLAY NOW' featuring the current 'SCORE: 15 m'. Inside, a placeholder image for an isometric pixel-art game scene (green meadows, blue water, pixelated characters). Below the image, a prominent 'START GAME' button.
- **Column 2 (User Stats):** A card titled 'PLAYER PROFILE' with a pixel-art avatar. Displays vertical stats for 'USERNAME: fb-123xyz', 'HIGHEST SCORE: 997 m', and 'TOTAL PLAY TIME: 12h 34m'. Bottom includes an 'EDIT PROFILE' button.
- **Column 3 (Rankings):** A card titled 'GLOBAL RANKING'. A table showing Rank (1-10), Player name, and Score. Highlight the scores in gold/yellow. Include pagination footer with 'PREVIOUS' and 'NEXT' and a status text 'UPDATES IN REAL TIME'.

**Visual Aesthetics:**
- Background Color: Deep Charcoal/Navy (#1a1d23).
- Card Style: Rounded corners (8-10px) with subtle shadows.
- Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter or Roboto).
- Accent Colors: Gold for high scores, light gray for secondary text, and blue/gray for primary buttons."
