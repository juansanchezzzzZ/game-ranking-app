  - Pixel-art logo 'PIXEL RANK' with a white icon.
  - Subtle tagline below: "Enter the Arena".

- **Login Mode:**
  - Title text: 'WELCOME BACK'
  - Input fields:
      - Email
      - Password
  - Primary button: 'SIGN IN'
  - Secondary text link: 'Create account'

- **Sign Up Mode:**
  - Title text: 'JOIN THE GAME'
  - Input fields:
      - Username
      - Email
      - Password
      - Confirm Password
  - Primary button: 'SIGN UP'
  - Secondary text link: 'Already have an account?'

- **Bottom Section:**

  - Small status text: 'Secure gaming platform'

**Visual Aesthetics:**
- Background Color: Almost black navy (#0b0f19).
- Card Style: Rounded corners (12px), soft outer glow, subtle neon edge.
- Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter or Roboto).
- Accent Colors:
    - Neon blue / cyan for primary buttons.
    - Soft purple for secondary links.
    - Light gray for labels.
